**Assignment:** Creating and Analyzing a RACI Chart

## Overview

This project outlines the development and analysis of a RACI chart for a pre-launch user acquisition campaign for a mobile application. The objective is to collect user email addresses and engagement data prior to launch in order to build a list of warm leads and engage them with marketing content. This approach is intended to improve initial user adoption and ensure product-market fit at launch.

## Part 2: RACI Chart Analysis

### Observations

- **Each task includes one “A” (Accountable):**  
  All tasks have clearly defined ownership, which prevents confusion and ensures clarity in execution.

- **Every task has at least one “R” (Responsible):**  
  All deliverables are assigned to someone responsible for execution, which ensures tasks are actively being worked on.

- **Balanced distribution of responsibilities:**  
  Jordan (Marketing) and Taylor (CRM) have multiple "R" roles, appropriate given their central roles in user engagement. Alex (PM) focuses on accountability, not direct execution, while Ben and Priya have focused contributions.

- **Appropriate use of “C” (Consulted):**  
  Experts like Priya (Design) and Taylor (CRM) are consulted at key moments, such as during asset creation and email automation.

- **Effective use of “I” (Informed):**  
  Alex and others are kept up to date on progress without being overwhelmed, supporting efficient communication.

### Revisions

The initial draft had some tasks missing “R” or “A” assignments. These were corrected to ensure:
- One and only one **A** per task.
- At least one **R** per task.
- Responsibilities redistributed where needed (e.g., Taylor is now both responsible and accountable for CRM automation tasks).

## Part 3: Integration into Airtable

### Steps to Add the RACI Chart to Airtable

1. **Create a New Table:**
   - Name the table: `RACI Matrix`.
   - Add one column for `Task/Subtask` (Single line text).
   - Add one column per team member (e.g., `Alex (PM)`, `Maria (Dev)`, etc.), formatted as **Single line text** or **Single select** with options R, A, C, I.

2. **Populate the Table:**
   - Copy and paste the final RACI assignments into the respective cells.
   - Use multiple values (e.g., `R, A`) where appropriate.

3. **Optional Enhancements:**
   - Use color-coding for R/A/C/I.
   - Add columns for task status, deadlines, or dependencies.

### Recommended Placement in Airtable

- **Project Overview Page:**  
  Embed the “RACI Matrix” table as a shared view or dashboard block to provide clear visibility into task responsibilities.

- **Launch Readiness Checklist or Campaign Tracker:**  
  Link the RACI table to task tracking views so assignments automatically reflect in related planning tools.
